# Redux Quiz

A quiz web app with 5 different quizzes using React/Redux for the Technigo React/Redux Upskill course in the autumn of 2023.

Developers: Joona M (@joona-3) and Sebastian Tigerschi√∂ld(@seti108)

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started the project by looking through the goals for the project and chose which goals we were aiming for. After that, we made a flowchart in FigJam to visualize the state, view and actions of our apps.

Once we had that done, we created a mockup of the design and decided on which componentes we should create. We then moved on to making the actual design in Figma.

Once we had everything planned and ready, we split the tasks between us and worked on our own.

If we had more time, we would have implemented the timer to automatically be a "wrong answer" if it ran out. Due to time constraints, we opted for a global timer using Redux to keep track of the total time the quiz took to finish.
